	\Large
	Véronique has three children: Pi, Racine and Hélène.\\
	They are either rational or irrational; Rational kids always tell the truth but irrational ones always lie.\\
	\\
	Véronique asks Pi: Are you rational or irrational?\\
	Pi responds stammering, Véronique does not hear his response.\\
	Racine then says "Pi said he was irrational",\\
	Hélène intervenes and says "Don’t believe Racine!".\\
	\\
	Is Racine rational or irrational?

	% Pi irrational => he says he is rational
	% Pi rational => he says he is rational
	% hence, Racine lied, so he is irrational
	% BONUS: Hélène is rational
