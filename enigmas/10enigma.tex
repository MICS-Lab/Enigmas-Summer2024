	At the beginning of September 2023, there were 50 times more bearded than beardless students at CentraleSup√©lec.
	But over the course of the year, 60 bearded students shaved.
	In addition, among the students who shaved, 4 left CS to pursue a university degree, and 8 ultimately opted for the bearded hipster look.
	At the end of the year, there were only 30 times more bearded people than hairless people.\\
	\\
	How many students were there at the beginning of September?
